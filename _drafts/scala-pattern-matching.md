Not so long ago I gave a presentation about Scala and ScalaTest to my co-workers. This was just basics as I wanted to give them a good and solid base for future researching this language. As it turned out - I probably learned a lot more than they did from this :)

Whenever there is _Scala_ mentioned there also is the phrase _pattern matching_. Of course Scala does support pattern matching but I didn't know how much fun one can have with this. In this post I'd like to show a few fun things we can do with this.
