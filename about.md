## Professional Experience

I'm working professionally as Java developer since 2011. Currently I work for [Allegro
Group][allegro]. It's the biggest online auctioning website in Poland. Previously I worked for
smaller company named [AIS.PL][ais].

## Interests

I like to do a lot of things, but the most fun for me are two below:

* _programming_ - I've started programming with C++ in 2002. Back then I was super excited about making games. Now, few years later - I'm still super excited about making games! Now I'm a Java developer. I do mostly webapp backends. For my personal projects I've tried a lot of programming languages. The one that keeps coming back is Scala. I'm using it for most of my non-work programming.
* _playing the guitar_ - since I was a kid I wanted to play the guitar so my parents got me one. I've played in a few bands but playing concerts is not my best way of spending time. I'd rather play just with my friends in the garage.

## Programming languages and technologies

As mentioned above I like learning various programming languages. I've tried very hard to like the dynamically typed languages like Python and Java Script. They are fun to play with because it's very easy to quickly make simple tools. Unfortunately this does not work very well when creating something bigger then BMI calculator... On the other hand static typing seemed too verbose. This was before I discovered Scala :)

Below I listed my favorite languages/technologies/whatever:

* Scala
* Java - I'm working with it professionally since 2012
* C/C++
* SQL
* HTML
* CSS
* Python
* Java Script
* Assembler - mostly basics
