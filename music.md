This is the place for all the music I've decided to share with the world. Please don't expect it to be very large collection. I don't usually record my guitar sessions but when I do I think that they're mostly not good enough for the world.

## Zegarmistrz Światła

This one I've recorded years ago. It's rather 5-minute solo with MIDI backing track but I think it's pretty nice :) (except the MIDI part)
